# NOTE: I found this interesting paper:
#   Constructing Client-Server Multi-Player Asynchronous Networked Games Using a Single-Computer Model
#     by Zimmerman et al.
#     @ URL: http://www.tffenterprises.com/~dmz/publications/conference/asyncnetgames.pdf
# It discusses how to approach turning a local multiplayer game to a networked one and uses Tron
#   specifically as an example. My net code should implement something very similar to what
#   they describe.

#FIXME allow host and port config from command line. what if port is appended to hostname?
HOST = ''
PORT = 11845

MAX_MSG_SIZE = 1024 # could go up to 1500? (well, could go up to max IP limit, technically)
#FIXME MAX_MOTD_SIZE should not exceed MAX_MSG_SIZE + header size (currently 3 bytes)
MAX_MOTD_SIZE = 1024

MAX_LOBBY_SIZE = 8

# these dimension units are in text cells, not pixels

#       says something about using threads because Python networking may be slow
