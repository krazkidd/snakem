Thanks for playing my snake game! This project doesn't have a real
name, so for the purposes of copyright and what-not, I'll just call it
Snake-M (M for Multiplayer).

Features:
* Networked multiplayer
* Lobby servers
* Maybe multiple game modes and bots (in the future...)

Currently the game should work on any PC platform. I think.

Playing the game:
  The main script is snake-game.py. Provided are two symlinks
`snake` and `snakes` which start the client or main server, 
respectively. (Do the symlinks work on Windows?)

  When the main server is started with `snakes`, it will start
several lobby servers and then listen for clients. Clients will
first contact the main server to retrieve a list of the lobby
servers and the ports they are listening on, display them to the
user, and then contact the selected lobby server.

  The lobby server relays messages between clients and maintains
an authoritative game state.
