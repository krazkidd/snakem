* in Snake.changeHeading():
  - still allows going backwards if the player quickly presses two arrow keys before move() is called. this could be fixed by using a flag so that only one direction change can happen per move()

* in Snake.move()?:
  - after adding body, check we haven't bitten ourself

* in Snake:
  - make deque for body

* in snake-game:
  - only allow one keypress event per game loop cycle OR fix Snake so it doesn't allow backwards movement
