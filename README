Thanks for playing my snake game! This project doesn't have a real
name, so for the purposes of copyright and what-not, I'll just call it
Snake-M (M for Multiplayer).

Features:
* Multiple lobbies per server
* Bots

Requires:
* Unix (due to some nuances of Python's os module)
* Python 2.7

Playing the game:
  The main script is snake-game.py. Provided are two symlinks
`snakem` and `snakes` which start the client or main server, 
respectively.

  When the main server is started with `snakes`, it will spawn
a number of lobby servers and then listen for clients. Clients will
first contact the main server to retrieve a list of the lobby
servers. The player must then select a lobby.

  The server keeps the authoritative game state (that is, the game
is not P2P).
